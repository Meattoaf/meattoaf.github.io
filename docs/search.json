    "text": "Genesis 12 begins with God instructing Abraham to leave his homeland of Haran. “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house,” God says (12:1). Even the destination is left vague: it is simply “the land that I will show you” (12:1). It is a journey marked by uncertainty, and one that requires a leap of faith.\nKaren Armstrong reflects on this passage:\n\nReligious people often speak of “faith” as though it were a matter of conserving the old and traditional; they claim that it gives them absolute certainty and is not compatible with doubt. But Genesis shows that in fact faith began by demanding a radical break with the past and facing the terrors and enigmas of the unknown. (Armstrong, 56)\n\nA similar sentiment is echoed in the Quran. In Surah Al-Baqarah, we find the verse:\n\nWhen it is said to them: ‘Follow what Allah hath revealed,’ they say, ‘Nay! We shall follow the ways of our fathers.’ What! Even though their fathers were void of wisdom and guidance? (2:170)\n\nThe call to break with the familiar resonates across faith traditions. And yet, for many, faith becomes a tautology born of fear: We believe in God because God commanded us to believe (or else).\n\n\n\n“The Departure of Abraham” in The National Gallery, London\n\n\nDavid Bentley Hart articulates everything that is wrong with this sort of faith in That All Shall Be Saved:\n\nSubmission to a morally unintelligible narrative of God’s dealings with his creatures would be a kind of epistemic nihilism, reducing the act of fidelity to God to a brutishly obstinate infidelity to reason (whose substance, again, is God himself). Submission of that kind could not be sincere, because it would make ‘true faith’ and ‘bad faith’—devotion to truth and betrayal of truth—one and the same thing. (Hart, 61)\n\nHart’s critique is brutal: devotion to truth and betrayal of truth become one and the same when you “believe” in something you don’t really think is intelligible. To betray one’s own beliefs out of fear can hardly be called belief at all. It is nothing more than self-preservation.\nIt is hard not to give into this sort of fear though. Given the threat of hell, faith - even hollow faith - can seem like a safer bet than confronting doubt, a kind of spiritual just in case. But this is like a hoarder clinging to worthless items out of a fear they might need them one rainy day. Eventually, they look around and realize that their home has become suffocating, that they are buried under the weight of what they were too afraid to let go of.\nI am not suggesting that one abandons faith the moment doubt arises. Not at all. But doubt is not the enemy. Whether it leads one deeper into their faith or towards a different path entirely, what matters is that the resulting belief is sincere. Anyone who genuinely cares about truth, and not just escaping a potential hellfire, should follow doubt to its natural conclusion. As the Muslim philosophers of the Brethren of Purity wrote, a seeker of truth should “shun no science, scorn no book, nor cling fanatically to a single creed,” (Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity). Nurture your doubts. And keep an open mind.\nJudaism, Christianity, and Islam all revere Abraham as a prophet and role model. So it is important that his faith was not a passive one. He walked a path that had not yet been revealed. If Abraham’s story is indeed a guide for our own lives, his story suggests that walking into the unknown, guided by a devotion to truth and not fear, is worth the risk.\n     \nReferences\nDavid Bentley Hart, “That All Shall Be Saved”\nKaren Armstrong, “In the Beginning: A New Interpretation of Genesis”\nEncyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity\nFurther Reading\nDo We Mistake Our Passion for Truth with Its Possession? - Renovatio"

    "text": "“Look,” whispered Chuck, and George lifted his eyes to heaven. (There is always a last time for everything.)\nOverhead, without any fuss, the stars were going out.\nThe Nine Billion Names of God, Arthur C. Clarke\n\nI recently finished Bart D. Ehrman’s Heaven and Hell: A History of the Afterlife. In the afterword, Ehrman reflects on the afterlife as someone who was raised in the Episcopal church before becoming agnostic later in life. He contemplates death as a simple fading away: no apocalypse, no resurrection, and no fanfare.\nReading it made me cry. I doubt that was Ehrman’s intention, but for someone raised in a religious environment, truly accepting the absence of an afterlife is no small thing. Even though I no longer believe in a literal heaven or hell, there is something in me that resists the thought of simply ceasing to be. As I read Ehrman’s afterword, I forced myself to imagine it - really imagine it: just blinking out of existence. And only then did I realize how heavy eternity feels (whodathunkit?) and how constantly I feel it.\nBut there is a reality where things don’t have to be so serious, so burdensome. A reality where the stars can go out without any fuss.\n\nPhoebe Bridgers’ I Know the End, from her sophomore album Punisher, evokes many of the same feelings that Ehrman’s afterword does. As the song’s title suggests, the song is about the apocalypse.\nSonically, the music in the first half of the song is sparse, with just Bridgers and her guitar. The melody is melancholy, her voice quiet and restrained. The lyrics depict a speaker struggling to come to terms with life’s monotony and the weight of depression. Days and places blur together (Somewhere in Germany, but I can’t place it / Man, I hate this part of Texas), and an emptiness settles over both her personal world and the world at large (Not even the burnouts are out here anymore). Then, the song shifts.\nA trumpet signals the transition to the second half of the song. The trumpet’s presence is no coincidence. Across religious traditions, trumpets are harbingers of the end. The Book of Revelation speaks of seven trumpets, each marking a stage of the apocalypse. The Quran refers to the blowing of the trumpet as a sign of the Day of Judgment, appearing is verses 6:73, 18:99, 20:102 to name a few.\n\nOn that day We shall leave them to surge like waves on one another; The trumpet will be blown, and We shall collect them all together (Quran 18:99, translated by Abdullah Yusuf Ali)\n\n\nAnd the third angel sounded the trumpet, and a great star fell out of heaven burning like a torch, and it fell upon one third of the rivers and upon the springs of the waters; And the star’s name is called Wormwood. And one third of the waters turned into wormwood, and a great many human beings died from the waters because they were embittered. (The Revelation of John 8:10-11, translated by David Bentley Hart)\n\nThe apocalypse, both in I Know the End and in the Quran, are accompanied by a sense of clarity. In his commentary on the Quran, Abdullah Yusuf Ali explains that with the first trumpet of resurrection, the world as we know it will cease to be. Humans will be dazed and lose all consciousness. But with the second trumpet, they will stand in a new world and see with clearer vision than ever before.\n\nThe Trumpet will (just) be sounded, when all that are in the heavens and on earth will swoon, except such as it will please Allah (to exempt). Then will a second one be sounded, when, behold, they will be standing and looking on! (Quran 39:68, translated by Abdullah Yusuf Ali)\n\n\n\n\n“The Great Day of His Wrath” - John Martin (1851)\n\n\nThis theme of clarity echoes in the lyrics that follow the trumpet’s call in I Know the End:\n\nDrivin’ out into the sun\nLet the ultraviolet cover me up\nWent looking for a creation myth\nEnded up with a pair of cracked lips\n\nThe speaker drives into the sun, a metaphor for her meeting her absurd and apocalyptic reality head-on. This solar imagery (ultraviolet, cracked lips) also evokes the myth of Icarus. She set out in search of a creation myth, an origin story to make sense of it all. But she finds nothing. She wanted it so desperately that she flew too close to the sun, left parched and empty-handed.\nOrigins matter. We can’t help but feel they tell us something essential about our character and purpose in the world. The Hebrew Bible begins, of course, with Genesis, a story full of origins. But what happens when we abandon that story? When we simply can’t believe in it anymore? Where does that leave us? Where does it leave the speaker?\n\nOver the coast, everyone’s convinced\nIt’s a government drone or an alien spaceship\nEither way, we’re not alone\nI’ll find a new place to be from\nA haunted house with a picket fence\nTo float around and ghost my friends\n\nThe answer is hopeful: Either way, we’re not alone. Even if she can’t find a creation myth - can’t bring herself to believe in the divine in any traditional sense - she can still glimpse something beyond herself in the secular world. She can create her own mythology (I’ll find a new place to be from).\nThese lines are also a reference to aliens, a theme that carries over from Bridgers’ song Chinese Satellite (which we will discuss in part 2). Ultimately, we just want to know we are not alone in this universe. We want to feel that there is something greater at play - whether that be intelligent extraterrestrial life or the God of Moses.\nBridgers also invokes the image of the picket fence, a symbol of idealized American suburban life, only to turn it on its head. She knows she will never have the traditional white-picket-fence dream, but, just as with the creation myth, she will carve out some version of it for herself.\n\nNo, I’m not afraid to disappear\nThe billboard said “The End Is Near”\nI turned around, there was nothing there\nYeah, I guess the end is here\n \nThe end is here\nThe end is here\nThe end is here\nThe end is -\n\nThe repetition of “The end is here” is sung by a chorus. One imagines the speaker looks behind her to see nothing at all, that the nothingness swallows her up, and she becomes part of the collective voice chanting those final lines.\nBut then, the final line is cut short. The chorus swells into cacophony and guttural screaming. These are not the cries of agony one might expect from an apocalyptic ending. Instead, they are the cathartic sounds of release: the sound of acceptance, of surrender, of confronting oblivion without fear.\nIn an interview, Bridgers explains that she imagines herself in the song driving up to Northern California, to the place where her grandparents once lived (Genius, Phoebe Bridgers “I Know The End” Official Lyrics & Meaning). But they don’t live there anymore. She is heading towards a sanctuary that no longer exists. And just as the sanctuary she seeks is gone, so too is the world of genesis and apocalypse that she wished she could believe in.\n\nIf we’re being technical, the chorus of screaming isn’t quite the end of the song. After the screams fade, we hear Bridgers in the studio, weakly attempting to scream, interspersed with giggling. It’s a whimsical reminder that this really isn’t so serious.\nUltimately, I Know the End isn’t about the end at all. It is about the joy of catharsis. The world may not end in fire, brimstone, or divine reckoning. It may simply fade into a cathartic scream, a tired breath, and then - laughter.\n     \nReferences\nDavid Bentley Hart, Translation of the New Testament\nAbdullah Yusuf Ali, Translation of the Quran\nBart D.

    "text": "Jin finds a drawing in his recently-comatose father’s notebook: a simple rectangle accompanied by the phrases “What is invisible and always visible” and “Much ado about nothing” with the word “nothing” underlined several times.\nJin attempts to find this rectangle in towers around Columbus, but is never quite convinced by them. Near the end of the movie, he tells Casey that he believes the drawing reflects this instead:\n\n\n\nColumbus City Hall, Columbus (2017)\n\n\nIt is a plain building made striking by the piece it lacks. The drawing is not of a rectangle, but of the absence of one.\nIn much the same way, Columbus is a film about what Casey and Jin are missing, and what has always been missing. The film is about lost opportunities, lost time, and the grief of it all.\nWhen we meet Casey and Jin, neither are satisfied with their lives. Casey loves architecture, but has for the most part given up on pursuing it to take care of her mother, a recovering meth addict. Jin has a strangled relationship with his ill father, who he has come to visit in Columbus. He tells his father’s colleague that they haven’t spoken in a year and though his father is a renowned architect, he himself doesn’t “know shit about architecture… or care.”\nAnd yet, Casey and Jin push each other to change. Casey asks Jin at some point, “Do you think he’s got a chance to recover? Even if it’s just enough to go back to Seoul?” Jin replies, “God, I hope not.” Casey is visibly upset by this. She is devoted so deeply to her mother that she turned down her dream career; she can’t imagine feeling the way that Jin does. She bitterly tells Jin that he doesn’t want his dad to get better simply to avoid to pain of mourning for him.\nJin, in turn, is frustrated by Casey’s inability to follow her passions, always prodding her to open up about her love of architecture despite her guardedness about it. When she is talking about one of her favorite buildings, we see her warbled reflection in the building’s window. Jin challenges Casey to really tell him what it is about the building that moves her instead of simply giving him a “tour guide” explanation. When he prompts her to speak about it, we no longer see her reflection, but Casey herself. We see her mouth move, but can’t hear what she says. Casey’s love swells to a point beyond words. She makes a rectangular shape with her hands. Jin seems to understand.\nDespite their arguments, Jin and Casey cannot help that they are now painfully aware of the absences in their lives. Jin attends a tour of a house Casey signed him up for despite earlier proclaiming he didn’t care about architecture. He begins to visit his father more frequently in the hospital.\nAt the end of the film, Casey decides to pursue her career, particularly after finding out her mom was not using again. And Jin spends more time with his father. He even buys his own apartment instead of moving back to Korea. Jin learns to stay, Casey learns to go.\nThe building that Jin sees near the end of the movie is Columbus City Hall. Two brick walls extend, “reaching out toward one another yet not quite meeting” (Architect Magazine), like an architectural imagining of The Creation of Adam.\n\n\n\nColumbus City Hall, Architect Magazine\n\n\nIn the context of the film, the gap represents a sort of anti-monument. A common feature of the anti-monument is inversion: voids instead of solids, absence instead of presence, darkness instead of light. Anti-monuments, even moreso than traditional monuments, are linked to loss.\nIt is of note then that part of what Casey loves about architecture is its solidity. The camera lingers on large structures that assert their presence. The solidity of the architecture is a comfort to Casey against the lack of solidity/stability in her own life. She says when looking up at one of her favorite buildings, “There were nights that my mom just wouldn’t come home at all. I had no clue where she was. That’s when I started coming here. I found it weirdly comforting. In the middle of all the mess, in this fucking strip mall…there was this…This….” She falls silent for a second time and makes a rectangle again with her hands. And just as with the gap in the entrance to Columbus City Hall, we feel the solid shape that hangs in the air.\n     \nReferences\nCounter Memorials and Monuments - A Possession Forever\nColumbus City Hall | Architect Magazine"

And I don’t know his real name.\nI like talking/writing about religion, movies, and math (among other things).\nThe painting above is “St. James Led to His Martyrdom” by Andrea Mantegna. It was painted some time in the 1400s.\nThis blog was made with Quarto by the way. Would recommend. Thanks for visiting my blog."

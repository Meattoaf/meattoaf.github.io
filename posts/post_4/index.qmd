**Idolatrous**

A woman uncoils

from a pit of evangelicals.

<br/>

Her breath caresses

my winter-bruised lips.

She says

<br/>

Come throw stones

at the statue of a woman,

that soft-spoken glutton, 

begging for more.

<br/>

I whisper back

<br/>

I was the one 

who chiseled out her nerves,

and I made sure they went 

past the curve of her neck.

I bathed her in blood.

I gave her a name.

<br/>

From her chest, a choir erupts:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Is Not Our Home

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Is Not Our Home

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Love, The Word

<br/>

I know

I know

But capitalize on the flesh 

And the bones will groan.

<br/>

The choir capsizes:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your mouth

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tastes like

silver.

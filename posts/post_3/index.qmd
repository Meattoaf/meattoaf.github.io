Genesis 12 begins with God instructing Abraham to leave his homeland of Haran. The magnitude of this command is not lost on God, who acknowledges the weight of what Abraham is being asked to leave behind. “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house,” God says (12:1). Even the destination is left vague—“the land that I will show you” (12:1). It is a journey marked by uncertainty, requiring an extraordinary leap of faith.

Karen Armstrong reflects on this passage:

> Religious people often speak of “faith” as though it were a matter of conserving the old and traditional; they claim that it gives them absolute certainty and is not compatible with doubt. But Genesis shows that in fact faith began by demanding a radical break with the past and facing the terrors and enigmas of the unknown. (Armstrong, 56)

A similar sentiment is echoed in the Quran. In Surah Al-Baqarah, we find the verse:

> When it is said to them: 'Follow what Allah hath revealed,' they say, 'Nay! We shall follow the ways of our fathers.' What! Even though their fathers were void of wisdom and guidance? (2:170)

The call to break with the familiar resonates across traditions. But for much of my life, I found it difficult to make that leap. I was worried my doubt itself was enought to invoke divine wrath. But my faith was a tautology born of fear: I believed in God because God said to believe. Faith for faith’s sake—a peversion of true faith that is potentially more deserving of incurring divine wrath.

David Bentley Hart articulates everything that is wrong with this sort of faith in *That All Shall Be Saved*:

> Submission to a morally unintelligible narrative of God’s dealings with his creatures would be a kind of epistemic nihilism, reducing the act of fidelity to God to a brutishly obstinate infidelity to reason (whose substance, again, is God himself). Submission of that kind could not be sincere, because it would make ‘true faith’ and ‘bad faith’—devotion to truth and betrayal of truth—one and the same thing. (Hart, 61)

Another verse from the Quran mirrors this sentiment. In this particular part of Surah Al-Naml, Musa (Moses) is performing miracles in front of the Pharoah and his people to prove his prophethood. And although he has convinced them, they deny it:

> And they rejected those signs in iniquity and arrogance, though their souls were convinced thereof: so see what was the end of those who acted corruptly. (27:14)

To betray one’s own beliefs out of fear can hardly be called belief at all. It is no more than a hollow act of self-preservation.

In *Genesis*, the characters are not merely individuals but symbols of the nations that arise from them. God’s preference for the youngest son—a recurring theme—seems a preference for the new, the untried, the emergent. I don’t think this was a value limited to their time, as if once the rules were written down, the need for exploration ceased. If these texts are indeed guides for life, they suggest that the courage to break from tradition is integral to faith.

Or perhaps this is my self-serving interpretation. Regardless, it is what I believe.

**My Own Private Idaho**

I am in the auburn room

of my chewed through stomach.

It is a shroud beyond the blackthorn trees.

I have left the rest of my flesh behind

and I am here with my mother. 

<br/>

She has never been before. 

She fills it with prune juice,

then pulls herself into the open wound, 

pressing down with her toes like cracked 

black pebbles.

She tilts her head up. I make her promise

that it was never hatred. 

<br/>

I am glad to be here - it is the like 

the beginning or the end.

Either way, there is no asphalt,

no reflection in the window at the train station,

nothing beloved departed from me, and

no breath of mine to 

bereave. 

<br/>

I can read a room. I can

ignore it too. 

I have denied myself on Godâ€™s behalf.

I have denied myself a biology. 

The sandy dirt clutched in my fist,

let go of too quickly. 

The grief becoming an artifact -

my own cancer 

growing yellow carnations out of the base of my throat.

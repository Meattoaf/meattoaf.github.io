Genesis 12 begins with God instructing Abraham to leave his homeland of Haran. “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house,” God says (12:1). Even the destination is left vague: it is simply “the land that I will show you” (12:1). It is a journey marked by uncertainty, and one that requires a leap of faith.

Karen Armstrong reflects on this passage:

> Religious people often speak of “faith” as though it were a matter of conserving the old and traditional; they claim that it gives them absolute certainty and is not compatible with doubt. But Genesis shows that in fact faith began by demanding a radical break with the past and facing the terrors and enigmas of the unknown. (Armstrong, 56)

A similar sentiment is echoed in the Quran. In Surah Al-Baqarah, we find the verse:

> When it is said to them: 'Follow what Allah hath revealed,' they say, 'Nay! We shall follow the ways of our fathers.' What! Even though their fathers were void of wisdom and guidance? (2:170)

The call to break with the familiar resonates across faith traditions. And yet, for many, faith becomes a tautology born of fear: We believe in God because God commanded us to believe (or else).

David Bentley Hart articulates everything that is wrong with this sort of faith in *That All Shall Be Saved*:

> Submission to a morally unintelligible narrative of God’s dealings with his creatures would be a kind of epistemic nihilism, reducing the act of fidelity to God to a brutishly obstinate infidelity to reason (whose substance, again, is God himself). Submission of that kind could not be sincere, because it would make ‘true faith’ and ‘bad faith’—devotion to truth and betrayal of truth—one and the same thing. (Hart, 61)

Hart's critique is brutal: devotion to truth and betrayal of truth become one and the same when you "believe" in something you don't really think is intelligible. To betray one’s own beliefs out of fear can hardly be called belief at all. It is nothing more than self-preservation.

It is hard not to give into this sort of fear though. Given the threat of hell, faith - even hollow faith - can seem like a safer bet than confronting doubt, a kind of spiritual _just in case_. But this is like a hoarder clinging to worthless items out of a fear they might need them one rainy day. Eventually, they look around and realize that their home has become suffocating, that they are buried under the weight of what they were too afraid to let go of.

I am not suggesting that one abandons faith the moment doubt arises. Not at all. But doubt is not the enemy. Whether it leads one deeper into their faith or towards a different path entirely, what matters is that the resulting belief is sincere. Anyone who genuinely cares about truth, and not just escaping a potential hellfire, should follow doubt to its natural conclusion. As the Muslim philosophers of the Brethren of Purity wrote, a seeker of truth should “shun no science, scorn no book, nor cling fanatically to a single creed,” (Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity). Nurture your doubts. And keep an open mind.

Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all revere Abraham as a prophet and role model. So it is important that his faith was not a passive one. He walked a path that had not yet been revealed. If Abraham's story is indeed a guide for our own lives, his story suggests that walking into the unknown, guided by a devotion to truth and not fear, is worth the risk.
